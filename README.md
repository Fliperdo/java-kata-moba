# java-kata-moba
Public repo for our teams practicing of the Java Kata for mob programming and our Assignment 2 for ESEP.

## Tooling
We are going to use Intellij - Code With Me. This will allow us all to have the project up and in front of us, so that anyone can take over with coding on a moments need and we don't have to worry about passing controls akwardly. It will also help us all effectively mob in the same style as pair programming would have you do. Additionally, we can all navigate the exact same in-progress code freely. There are also some really nice tools for following other devs and it has cool change tracking features for individual contributors.
